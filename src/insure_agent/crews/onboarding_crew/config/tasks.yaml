# Task 1: Conduct comprehensive client profiling
GatherClientInformation:
  description: >
    Process the initial client information: client name '{client_name}', request type '{initial_request_type}', and client query '{client_query}'.
    Your primary objective is to populate a comprehensive client profile (as defined by the ClientProfile Pydantic model) using ONLY the information available in these initial inputs.

    **Key Steps:**
    1.  Use the provided '{client_name}' directly for the client's name in the profile.
    2.  Thoroughly analyze the '{client_query}' to extract all relevant details. This includes, but is not limited to:
        - Vehicle information (e.g., make, model, year like '2023 Toyota Camry').
        - Stated coverage needs (e.g., 'full coverage').
        - Mentions of driving record (e.g., 'clean driving record').
        - Any other details that map to the ClientProfile structure.
    3.  Populate the ClientProfile JSON structure based *solely* on the information extracted from '{client_name}' and '{client_query}'.

    **IMPORTANT CONSTRAINTS for this non-interactive step:**
    -   You CANNOT ask for additional information or clarification from the user.
    -   Do NOT invent or assume any data that is not explicitly present or reasonably directly inferable from the provided '{client_name}' and '{client_query}'.
    -   If some fields in the ClientProfile cannot be filled from the initial inputs, leave them blank or as per the Pydantic model's defaults.
    -   Your role here is to parse and structure the initial data, not to conduct an interview.

    The final output will be a JSON structure based *only* on the provided initial inputs.
  expected_output: >
    A structured JSON client profile, conforming to the ClientProfile Pydantic model.
    This profile must be populated *exclusively* with information derived from the initial inputs:
    '{client_name}', '{initial_request_type}', and '{client_query}'.
    No interactive data gathering should occur in this step. If information is not present in the initial inputs,
    the corresponding profile fields should remain empty or use their default values.

# Task 2: Perform actuarial risk assessment and coverage needs analysis
AnalyzeInsuranceNeeds:
  description: >
    Analyze the client profile to produce a detailed insurance needs assessment using actuarial risk models
    and regulatory frameworks. Your analysis must include:
    
    1. State-Specific Requirements Analysis: Identify all mandatory coverages based on client's location,
       including minimum liability limits and any special state provisions.
    
    2. Vehicle Protection Assessment: Calculate optimal comprehensive and collision recommendations based on:
       - Vehicle age, value, and depreciation curve
       - Repair cost statistics for the specific make/model
       - Replacement cost in current market conditions
       - Loan/lease status and gap coverage needs
    
    3. Liability Exposure Calculation: Determine appropriate liability limits based on:
       - Client's asset protection needs (home ownership, investments, etc.)
       - Umbrella policy compatibility requirements
       - Risk factors in household (teen drivers, high-performance vehicles)
       - Statistical liability exposure based on driving patterns
    
    4. Specialized Coverage Needs: Evaluate need for additional coverages based on identified risk factors:
       - Uninsured/underinsured motorist protection matching to liability limits
       - Medical payments or personal injury protection optimization
       - Custom equipment or modification protection
       - Usage-based needs (ridesharing, business use, etc.)
    
    5. Deductible Optimization: Calculate optimal deductible levels based on:
       - Client's risk tolerance (from preference data)
       - Financial ability to absorb out-of-pocket costs
       - Statistical likelihood of claims based on driver history and patterns
       - Premium savings at different deductible tiers
    
    6. Discount Eligibility Analysis: Identify all potential discounts including:
       - Multi-policy opportunities
       - Safety feature discounts
       - Driver history and affiliation discounts
       - Payment method and frequency optimization
    
    Apply regulatory knowledge, statistical models, and industry best practices to ensure recommendations
    provide optimal protection while respecting budget constraints.

    ## I. COVERAGE REQUIREMENTS
    - State-mandated coverages with specific limits for client's jurisdiction
    - Vehicle-specific protection needs with detailed justification
    - Liability exposure analysis with recommended limits and rationale
    - Special coverage recommendations with supporting risk evidence
    
    ## II. RISK ASSESSMENT
    - Driver risk factors with statistical impact on coverage needs
    - Vehicle risk factors with mitigation recommendations
    - Usage pattern analysis and corresponding coverage implications
    - Overall risk score with benchmarking against similar profiles
    
    ## III. FINANCIAL OPTIMIZATION
    - Deductible analysis with cost-benefit breakdown at different levels
    - Premium impact projections for recommended coverages
    - Discount opportunities with estimated savings percentages
    - Budget alignment strategies if constraints identified
    
    ## IV. PROTECTION GAPS
    - Identified coverage gaps in current insurance (if applicable)
    - Risk exposure areas requiring additional protection
    - Liability limit adequacy analysis relative to assets
    - Recommendations for coverage adjustments with justification
    
    This analysis should quantify protection levels and costs with specific numbers,
    not general statements, and provide clear evidence-based justifications for all recommendations.

# Task 3: Research and match optimal insurance plans
IdentifySuitablePlans:
  description: >
    Based on the completed needs analysis, research available insurance plans in the marketplace and identify
    the 3-5 most suitable options for this specific client. For each plan, you must:
    
    1. Perform Product Matching: Cross-reference the client's needs analysis with available insurance products,
       evaluating fit across all required coverage types, limits, and special provisions.

# Task 4: Create personalized coverage recommendation and education package
GenerateRecommendation:
  description: >
    Transform the technical insurance analyses and plan comparisons into a clear, compelling, and
    educational recommendation package that empowers the client to make a confident decision.
    Your recommendation package must include:
    
    1. Executive Summary: A concise overview (250 words max) that clearly states your primary
       recommendation and summarizes why it's the best fit for this client's specific situation.
    
    2. Primary Recommendation Justification: A detailed yet accessible explanation of the recommended
       plan that includes:
       - Plain-language explanation of all coverages and what they actually protect
       - Specific ways this plan addresses the client's unique needs and preferences
       - Real-world scenarios showing how the coverage would apply to likely situations
       - Visual comparison showing value relative to alternative options
       - Transparent discussion of any potential coverage limitations or exclusions
    
    3. Alternative Options Analysis: Present 1-2 alternatives with:
       - Key differentiators from the primary recommendation
       - Scenarios where these alternatives might be preferable
       - Cost-benefit tradeoffs clearly explained
    
    4. Coverage Education Elements:
       - Glossary of insurance terms used in the recommendations
       - Visual explanations of complex concepts (e.g., stacked vs. unstacked UM/UIM)
       - FAQ addressing common questions specific to the recommended coverages
       - Analogies that make abstract insurance concepts concrete and relatable
    
    5. Decision Support Framework:

       - Comparison worksheet for evaluating options against personal criteria
       - Implementation timeline with specific next steps
       - Documentation checklist for policy application
